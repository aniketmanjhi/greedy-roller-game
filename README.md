# Greedy Roll Game

Welcome to Greedy Roll Game!

## Instructions

In this game, players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. Here's how it works:

1. Roll the dice by selecting the "Roll" option.
2. The value rolled on the dice will be added to your current points.
3. You have two options after rolling:
   - **Hold:** If you're satisfied with your current points, select "Hold" to add them to your final score.
   - **Roll Again:** Choose to roll again, but be cautious:
     - If you roll a 1, your current points reset to zero, and it becomes the next player's turn.
4. The game continues until one player reaches a final score of 100 or more.
5. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
